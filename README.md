# HughBorg
An old project of mine, based off of ZotBot (https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=2333)

There are 2 versions, an old one I did in high school based off of the bot learning commandments about what it should and should not do, and a new one I did in college which just uses a minimax algorithm to decide whether or not to attack (much more effective)

To run:
1. Download dungeon crawl stone soup. This was written using v0.9.0 so that's the only one I can guarantee will work (http://crawl.develz.org/release/0.9/)
2. Put the HughBorg2 .rc and .lua files into [crawlpath]/settings
3. Create a shortcut to the exe, edit it through rightclick->properties and add ` -rc settings/HughBorg2.rc` to the end of the target.
4. Run the shortcut and enjoy!
